The API docs are included as a separate jar file.  Other documents are included
under the html directory under docs and wrapped as pdf's for separate release.

I created an 'install' target within the ANT buildfile.  At the moment it
creates jar files for SailAway and Clados and places them in the lib directory. 
Because we are still developing everything, the SailAway.jar file will also
include the related javadocs.  In the long run, the jar files will be moved to
an installation directory choosen by the user.

With the jar files, it should be possible to invoke SailAway by running
SailAway.jar as you would any other jar file.  The application class should be
correctly labelled and activated on any system with a JVM.

Be aware that SailAway currently requires the installaton of Java3D.

SailAway still isn't mature enough to warrent an 'install' target, but ANT makes
it so easy to build it that I think I will do it soon. Issuing the 'ant install'
command from a command line should do the trick of getting the sailaway.jar file
and the related configuration files into a place where the application may be
invoked from a similar command line. Expect this before too long.

SailAway isn't mature enough yet to deserve an 'install' instruction set. The
compilation done by make places the class files alongside the java source files.
The 'run' target within the makefile runs the application in place. The 'clean'
target removes the class files from the source tree to prepare for another
compilation.

A little later I will alter the default make target to cause compilation to dump
class files in a directory next to the SailAway source tree.
