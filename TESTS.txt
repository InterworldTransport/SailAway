	SailAway Testing Plan

The application is still in its early days, so testing is done
right along side development.  The only ephemeris test that can
be done right now is to check if the orbit parameters alter the
way they should when the StepForward and StepBackward methods in
the Sail are called.  

All other testing at this time involves seeing if the feature
being added to SailAway is actually reachable from the user 
interface and event model.  Whether the feature works as it
should gets to be tested later.

There is a 'run' target within the makefile.  It simply runs
the java interpreter with the SailAway class and the default
support files.  (This is going to be converted to an Ant target
with a similar function.  The old makefile will be left intact
but it will not be maintained.  If you don't have Ant, get it
soon and make the switch.)
