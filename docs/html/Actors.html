<b>The Academic Researcher</b>
<p>
This actor is likely to be interested a variety of notions regarding sail flight
in the inner solar system. They may be looking for optimization ideas, science
value for a particular flight, or something apparently unrelated to solar
sailing. It is very likely that every feature of the application should be open
to this actor unless there is a really good reason why it should not be.
<p>
<b>The Celestial Mechanics/Navigation Student</b>
<p>
This actor is interested in the application as a learning tool. Features of the
application that deliver a 'student' experience are most likely to be useful.
Some of the automation of simulations and the related resources will probably
not be needed.
<p>
<b>The Solar Sail Engineer</b>
<p>
This actor is similar to the academic researcher except that they only care
about the nuts and bolts of sail flights. Tangential topics will probably be of
little interest. This actor is most likely going to be the first to notice bugs
and resource bottlenecks. They are unlikely to care all that much about how the
application does what it does.
<p>
<b>The SailAway Librarian</b>
<p>
It is possible for this actor may also be an 'Academic Researcher' or an 
inanimate remote library.  Each possibility is listed below but will be treated
the same by the system.
<p>
This actor is the one who cares to see that research is available to the
community with little duplication. The librarian will be the one to provide
resources for the collection of data from previous simulations for browsing by
future users.
<p> 
This actor represents an internet resource willing to act as a remote datastore.
This datastore will function much like a local library, but may do so with a
completely differrent set of business rules and an external application.
<p>
<b>The Notification Tool</b>
<p>
This actor is an application resposible for accepting input from SailAway and
getting it to the user requesting it. It may be something as simple as an email
outlet or something more complex like a web page generator or file handling
script.
<p>
<b>The 'Uneducated' Supporter</b>
<p>
This actor is the person who wants to support the research of other users, but
does not feel they have the background to do the research themselves. This actor
is most likely going to provide computing resources, time, and/or money to the
efforts of others.
<p>
<b>The Simulation Clock</b>
<p>
This actor represents the external clock that may be used by a list of commands
provided by another actor when the System is to be run without direct
interaction.
