SailAway Project - 'The Problem Being Solved.'
<blockquote>
Solar Sail research is done by a variety of people using tools that range from
home grown to sophisticated mathematical and engineering analysis.  While some
of the end results of this research do get published and survive the ups and
downs of any one person's interest in the subject, the tools themselves rarely
get traded or improved unless two like minded researchers can find each other
and not violate the intellectual property laws that govern their work.
<p>
For the state of the art to advance more efficiently, the tools, intermediate
research, and tested solutions to posed problems must survive in a knowledge
base accessible to all others interested in solar sails. The demise of solar
sail projects must not lead to the demise of the knowledge gained by those who
support the project.

SailAway Project - 'Why Solve The Problem?'
<blockquote>
A careful reading of the solar sail literature shows that the subject matter
covered by theorists proposing solar sail missions is generally confined to a
few mission types.  These missions can be modelled by current tools or minor
improvements on older tools.
<p>
Solar Sail mission planners spend considerable time rebuilding necessary
analysis tools for non-impulsive, long duration flights and extended, filmy
spacecraft structures or they make strong flight or structural restrictions and
use simpler planning tools.
<p>
Many flight plans are developed as intermediate results resulting from
optimization attempts or solution space searches along the way to a different
published result.
<p>
Duplication of effort, restricted research, and the lack of availability of a
body of knowledge representing what is and isn't possible leads to
inefficiencies in the research community. These inefficiencies are found among
the flight planners, the spacecraft engineers, and the science and commercial
customers who might actually fly instruments on a sail.
<p>
Solving this problem reduces research inefficiencies and further enables those
wishing to promote the use of solar sails for solar system transportation.

SailAway Requirements Specification - 'A Case Study'
<blockquote>
We are intent on developing an automated tool for the simulation of structure
and flight of solar sails in the inner solar system. This tool will enable
researchers to record sail designs, initial conditions, and expected final
conditions for simulation and return to them ephemerides, structural histories,
and optimization choices that result from the simulation run they started. The
tool will also maintain a library of prior simulations in order to support
solution space searches by researchers and faster response times for casual
browsers.
<p>
When a researcher first plans a simulation, they record the details concerning
the structure of their sail and the initial internal conditions into the tool or
choose an already described sail stored in the library. After choosing or
describing a sail the researcher describes the initial external conditions and
the desired final conditions for their sail. Both condition sets may be choosen
from examples stored in the library. The initial condition set is optional for
simulations designed to determine the internal structure of a sail without
concern for external conditions beyond force sources. The final condition set is
optional for simulations with no flight end boundry conditions.  
<p>
The tool will verify whether the sail description and initial and final
conditions are physically possible or meaningful and reject those that are not.
External initial and final conditions are defined in terms of physical
properties external to the sail that describe the physics of a flight such as
position, velocity, accelertion, momentum, angular momentum and other sources of
force upon the sail besides solar gravity and photons. Internal initial
conditions are defined in terms describing the physical properties of the sail
that do not depend on external references such as sail fabric reflectivity,
emmissivity, spar strengths, and attenna look angles.
<p>
Once a simulation plan has been established, the researcher defining it may run
it. The tool will make use of whatever resources are registered as available on
the net and that it deems necessary to produce the results requested by the
researcher. The researcher will be able to check up on the state of their
simulation periodically by submitting a query to the tool. When so requested,
the tool will gather a snapshot of the simulation and deliver it to the
researcher.
<p>
During a simulation, a researcher may interact with their simulation through an
established set of commands available to them through a user interface. The
researcher may also pre-plan a set of commands by defining a macro to be used by
the simulation instead of a human interaction through their user interface.
Macros will be able to support time based commands and simple what-if
conditional commands.
<p>
Assuming the simulation encounters no physical impossibilities, it will run to
completion with or without human interaction and then deliver its results to the
address specified by the researcher and to the library for future use.
