		A Sail is a Sail Model and a Sail Property Set along with all the

		sufficiently and control the interactions.
		<p>
		The Sail must have some mechanism to flatten or serialize itself for 
		export to files and transport over a network.  No outside method is 
		expected to know how to do this as well as the Sail itself will.
		<p>
		The old SailAway application has an existing Sail object that can be
		modified to meet the needs of the new design while retaining the already
		working parts of the physical model.

		minimum, a Flight Assumption has a state, a conditional statement, and a
		command.

		A Validation Test is some conditional statement made about an object

		for use in a Simulation.  Each Validation Test states what the Object
		must be like in order to pass.  
		<p>
		Since a Validation Test is an object itself, it can also contain the 
		results of the test.  So, at a minimum, a Validation Test has a state, 
		an object to be tested, a conditional statement, and a test result.

		A Validation Test List can handle the need to deliver a combined set of

		first place.  So, at a minimum, a Validation Test List has a state, a 
		list of Validation Tests, and object to be tested, a test result 
		summary, and enough methods to cycle through the Validation tests while 
		keeping track of where it is and the first test to fail.
