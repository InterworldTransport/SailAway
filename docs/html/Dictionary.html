		A Sail Model is a consistent set of Sail Elements.  Consistency is a
		measure of the completeness of the information of a Sail Model.  An
		example of an incomplete model is one that would immediately fly as two
		separate vehicles at the start of a simulation.  A Sail Model is
		consistent when physical properties describing it have meaning like they
		would for a atomic rigid body.

		An Orbit is the external path a Sail takes around a gravitational

		<p>
		Orbits are often described in terms of a paramter set that can be used
		to algebraically represent the path in an equation.  The actual
		parameters used depends on the shape and what one intends to do with
		them.  SailAway treats parameter sets as secondary information to be
		derived from the Orbit's defining properties like angular momentum and
		the Runge-Lenz object (eccentricity vector.)

		There are differnt approaches to managing perturbations acting on
		satellites in gravitational orbits.  The different approaches are used
		to deliver results for orbits of different shapes and different
		parameter sets.  The method used by SailAway is described in 'The
