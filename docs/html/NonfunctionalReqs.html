	<font size=2 color=darkred>
	No matter how the SailAway application is developed, the design must
	support the separation of the user interface, the event model, and the physical
	model.  The Library must be treated as a separate application, so it's
	design is not within the scope of this project.

	The physical model must be able to accept commands to iterate forward or
	backward along an orbit one step at a time.  Commands for multiple steps or
	stepping while or until conditions are met are properly part of the user
	interface.

	The physical model must publish a basic set of commands to which it will
	respond when so ordered by the event model.  These commands do not need to
	be in a spoken language since it is the responsibility of the user
	interface to correctly link spoken language commands to the physical model
	through the event model.

	It must be possible to plug in user interfaces into the system as

	UI's will function by adhering to the API of the physical model
	<p>
	In order to meet this requirement, it may be necessary to place each of the
	application packages into different jar files.  It is probably true that the
	physical model will have to be separated out at a minimum.

	Every user interface capable of storing or retrieving storable objects must
	be able to handle a flat XML formatted file.  The minimal demands for
	library interaction involve passing XML files that represent the contents
	ofthe storable objects, so each UI that can save or retrieve must be able to
	handle these at a minimum.

	The developer's UI should be have a very slim profile.  A menu, tool bar, 
	and status bar should be enough.  The user would show the windows to objects
	they intend to view from menu or toolbar choices they make.  These separate
	windows would stay in touch with the main interface and update as various
	commands were completed.

	<font size=2 color=darkred>
	The researcher's UI should be a collection of windows into the various
	objects they have up and active as working objects.  These windows would
	demonstrate to which objects they belong and what remains to be done with
	them.  The constructive hints from validators would appear at the bottom of
	these viewers.  An enclosed desktop approach to containing these viewers is
	the desired one.

<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=2 color=darkred>
	The Supporter's UI should keep to a rule of not allowing creation of new
	objects through the UI.  Instead, it should focus upon giving a good 
	presentation for objects already in the library.  It should also make it
	very easy to run short 'templated' command sequences on those existing
	objects.  These templates would be determined by what outside observers tend
	to focus their questoins upon.  A well developed FAQ will be needed before
	this requirement is fleshed out.

	The Notification Tool is assumed to be a separate application like email,
	IRC or some other messaging system.  No real requirements are being made for
	covering all types of messaging system, but email will be expected as the
	default option.  The system must be able to format outgoing messages
	according to the protocol type used by the messaging system.  Because of
	this, the System must understand how to construct a basic email message or
	hand the information to an object that can do the work and comes as a 
	standard on all machines that can run SailAway.

	When an application delivers or receives a storable object from a remote 
	library, the object will be transferable as an XML file.   All GUI's that
	interact with libraries will be able to accept the flat file format, so
	each library must be able to handle XML representations of objects at a
	minimum.
	<p>
	It is perfectly acceptable if the library stores the objects in a different
	format, however.  A librarian may choose to store serialized objects,
	tabular data, or any other format they wish.  They may also be willing to
	transfer storable objects in formats other than XML.  As long as the
	library can handle the one basic format that is assumed useable by all the
	advanced UI's, any extra features offered by the Librarian are their own
	business.

	All transactions between the System and a Library must be secured in the
	sense that that both sides must be able to identify the source and target 
	user of the request.  It is not necessary that the transaction be secured in
	the cryptographic sense yet because there are no passwords involved.  This
	kind of security is mostly a naming scheme, but will eventually evolve into
	a higher security system to support the creation of research groups with
	interests in closing their research long enough to publish in a competitive
	environment.
