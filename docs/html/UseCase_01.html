	Summary
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	A user records into the system details about a sail model. These details 
	will add up to enough information for the system to treat the model as a 
	real physical object that obeys real physics laws. Information that makes up
	a sail model includes detail about the mass, shape, locations, and System 
	Level Context contraints on every portion of the sail. The system receives 
	all input and validates it against templates.  Acceptable information is 
	then added to the sail model and saved.  	The system informs the user when 
	the sail model is complete enough to be considered well formed for the
	purpose of using it in a simulation.

	If the system is configured to use any library at step 4, it will store the 
	sail model in a library with related information.
	<p>
	If the system is configured to use a library at step 1, it will present the
	user with the option to load a pre-existing model to act as a starting point
	for further additions or deletions to the model.
	<p>
	If multiple libraries are available, the storage and retrievals use cases
	will make the decisions regarding which ones to use.

	Extension Points
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	When the System records elements from a sail model, these elements are
	passed through a validator.  This occurs at step 3.
	<p>
	When the System records a sail model in a library at step 4, it will use a 
	separate process to do the actual saving due to the complexity of the 
	interaction between the System and a remote library and the fact that the 
	separate process can be re-used by other sections of the system.
	<p>
	When the System retrieves a sail model from a library at step 1, it will use
	a separate process to do the actual getting due to the complexity of the
	interaction between the System and a remote library and the fact that the 
	separate process can be re-used by other sections of the system.
