	Summary
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	A user records into the system details about the initial conditions of a
	sail flight.  These details involve an initial sail and command set.  The
	System facilitates the gathering of this information from the user if the
	use mode for the System is interactive and the marking of the parts for
	inclusion in a simulation.
	<p>
	When the user completes all the information gathered by the System for this
	case, they will have a simulated flight that may be checked for consistency
	and then run.

	If the system is configured for the use of a library, any changes in step 2,
	3, or 4 will automatically be associated and saved with the current working 
	flight in the library.
	<p>
	If the system is configured to use a library at step 1, it will present the
	user with the option to load a pre-existing flight to act as a starting 
	point for further additions or deletions.
	<p>
	If multiple libraries are available, the storage and retrievals use cases
	will make the decisions regarding which ones to use.

	Exception Paths
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	At step 5, simulations that are not well-formed are brought to the 
	attention of the user via the Notification Tool.  Additions are saved as
	part of the simulation, though, unlike invalid additions to the subparts of
	a simulation.

	Extension Points
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	When the System adds objects to a flight simulation, these changes trigger a
	testing process to determine whether the whole collection is well-formed.  
	This occurs at step 5.
	<p>
	When the System records a simulation in a library at step 6, it will use a 
	separate process to do the actual saving due to the complexity of the 
	interaction between the System and a remote library and the fact that the 
	separate process can be re-used by other sections of the system.
	<p>
	When the System retrieves a simulation from a library at step 1, it will use
	a separate process to do the actual getting due to the complexity of the
	interaction between the System and a remote library and the fact that the 
	separate process can be re-used by other sections of the system.
