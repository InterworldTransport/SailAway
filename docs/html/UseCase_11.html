	<font size=3>
	At the request of the user, the system will run the well formed simulation
	named by the user.  The system will first check to see that the named
	simulation is well formed and then run it to completion without further
	input from the user.  Information marked in the simulation as data to be
	saved for later delivery by the Notification Tool will be saved and marked
	as such.

	If a simulation named by the user is not well formed when the user requests
	that it be run, the system will deliver useful error messages to the user
	that explains why the simulation is not well formed.  The system will then
	provide for a mechanism to allow the user to make alterations to the
	simulation for potential resubmission.
	<p>
	If the simulation violates any of the entries on the Flight Assumptions List
	at the end of any command, the simulation is stopped as though it had
	reached the end of the command list.  The identity of the violated Flight
	Assumption is delivered to the User through the Notification Tool along with
	the Command that broke it.

<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	If the system is not configured for the use of a library, the local
	environment must be large enough to permit the storage of the objects
	generated by the simulation.  These objects might be listed or they might
	just be the default set.
	<p>
	If the system is configured for the use of a library, a connection must be
	available to the library for the storage of the objects generated by the
	simulation.

	Preconditions
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	A well formed simulation must exist before the system will proceed beyond 
	the first step.  A well
	formed simulation consists of the following required objects.
	<ul>
	<li>A complete sail model
	<li>A complete set of initial conditions for the sail model
	<li>A complete set of properties for the sail flight
	<li>A complete set of flight assumptions for relevant perturbations
	</ul>
	A well formed simulation may optionally contain objects from the following
	list.
	<ul>
	<li>A set of final conditions for the sail flight
	<li>A set of conditional commands issued as macros
	</ul>
	</font>
</td>

	Postconditions
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	After a simulation is run, there may be a number of objects created to be
	handed off to the Notification Tool for delivery to the user or elsewhere.
	This object list may optionally include any of the following.
	<ul>
	<li>A set of final conditions for the sail flight
	<li>A set of commands issued as macros or from contingencies.
	<li>A sail model history
	<li>A flight history
	</ul>
	Which, if any, objects are collected for delivery to the Notification Tool
	is determined from a list of expected outputs provided by the user prior to
	the running of this simulation.  No list is required, though, since the user
	may come back later and simply request these objects from a library if one 
	was used or from the local environment.
