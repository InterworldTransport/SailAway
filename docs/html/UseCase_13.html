	Basic Course of Events
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	<ul>
	<li>The user enters the System.
	<li>The System creates a blank 'user info'.  Any old user info is deleted.
	<li>The System responds by presenting an interface where the user may
	identify themselves.
	<li>If the User is new to the System, basic information is requested through
	the same interface.
	<li>If the User is known to the System, their old information is stored
	within user info.
	<li>The System creates a blank 'user test result' and associates it with
	user info.
	<li>The System passes user info through a test in the test queue.
	<li>The test returns results to the System.
	<li>The results are appended to the test result.
	<li>If the test results are negative, processing stops and the test result
	is returned to the interface gathering user information
	<li>If the test results are negative, a copy of the test result is handed to
	the Notification Tool for delivery to the user.
	<li>If the test results are positive and further tests need to be performed,
	processing returns to step 7 using the next queued test.
	<li>If the test results are positive and no further tests need to be
	perfomred, the test result is returned to the interface gathering user
	information

	Exception Paths
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	Until this validator marks the user information as sufficient, the user
	effectively operates as an anonymous user.  Some remote resources may be
	willing to accept interactions with partial infromation, but the System will
	not count upon it.

	Trigger
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>

	The System triggers this case when a process that relies upon user data

	desire to operate anonymously.

	Assumptions
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	If the system is being run in batch mode and user information is missing,
	the simulation validator will determine that the simulation is is being run
	as a partially anonymous user.

<th align=left valign=top>
	Preconditions
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	There may be files present on the local hardware that provide user
	infromation sufficient to supply all that is needed for user validation.
	Check to see if such a file exists.

	Postconditions
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	After this process is done, sufficient user information is available to
	identify the user running a simulation for all downstream processes.  It is
	not known for sure (in the security sense) that the user information is
	correct.  This process will not prevent fraudulent identification.
