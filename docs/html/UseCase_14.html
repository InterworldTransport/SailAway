	Summary
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	A user records into the system details about the external properties of a
	sail.  These details will add up to enough information for the system to
	treat a related model as a rigid physical object that obeys rigid physics
	laws.  Information that makes up a sail property set includes detail about
	the location of the center of mass, the total linear momentum, the focus of
	the Sail's orbit and other external properties.

	If the system is configured for the use of a library at step 4, the sail 
	property set will saved in the library along with any information about a 
	related sail model.
	<p>
	If the system is configured for the use of a library in step 1, the sail 
	property set associated with the current model stored in the library will be
	made avialable to the user as a starting point for possible refinement or 
	use as is.  Other property sets will be made available too, but they will be
	clearly marked as not yet being associated with the model.

	Extension Points
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	When the System records properties for a sail property set, these properties
	are passed through a validator.
	<p>
	When the System records a property set in a library, it will use a
	separate process to do the actual saving due to the complexity of the
	interaction between the System and a remote library and the fact that the 
	separate process can be re-used by other sections of the system.
	<p>
	When the System retrieves a property set from a library, it will use a
	separate process to do the actual getting due to the complexity of the
	interaction between the System and a remote library and the fact that the 
	separate process can be re-used by other sections of the system.
