</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	Any time the User opens a storable object to make it their current working
	copy, the System will offer objects from remote libraries which are
	registered for use.  The User will be made aware of remote object available
	to them and in which libraries these objects happen to be stored.  If the
	User picks an object for retieval, the object will be requested from the
	local or remote library as appropriate and delivered to the System.

	Basic Course of Events
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	<ul>
	<li>The User shows a desire to work with an existing storable object.
	<li>If the system is configured for the use of a remote library, the 
	reachable libraries will be queried for information about their contents
	that may be accessed by the user.
	<li>The results of each query will be appended to the local list and 
	presented for the user to pick the object they wish to retrieve.
	<li>The User will pick one or several objects.
	<li>The System will attempt to retrieve all objects marked by the user.

	<font size=3>
	If the system is not configured to make use of a remote libary, it will 
	search the user's local environment for an existing local library and
	present only those objects for choosing.  The user will be made aware,
	though, that no remote libraries are being used.

	Exception Paths
</th>
<td align=left valign=top>
	<font size=3>
	If the system is configured for a remote libary and after trying to retrieve
	an object the registered library reports problems, the system will hunt for 
	another registered libary that contains the object and issue the task 
	request again.
	<p>
	If the system is configured for a libary and after trying to retrieve an
	object all registered libraries report problems, the system will revert to 
	a local library configuration and proceed.  If the object being requested in
	not in the local library, the System will report an error to the User
	through the Notification tool.

	The System must be able to find a Library somewhere whether it be remote or
