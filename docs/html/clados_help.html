			<h3>Clados Package Overview</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		A Clifford Algebra is a mathematical object useful for 
		representing geometry in an algebraic manner.  The physics  of 
		celestial mechanics was born from geometry observations yet it 
		is calculated today with algebra.  Calculus has its roots in 
		geometry and algebra.  Uniting the two mathematical arenas gives 
		those simulating the physics a very powerful programatic tool.
		<p>
		<h4>Clados = CLifford Algebra Derived ObjectS</h4>
		<p>
		There are other approaches to implementing geometry manipulation
		code.  Most are based upon the handling of matricies.  Using 
		Clifford Algebras is simply better.  Some knowledgeable people 
		may debate this, but we don't.  The reason we don't is that many
		programmatic errors are easily avoided with Clifford Algebra 
		derived objects.  Besides, the generators of Clifford Algebras 
		can be cast as matrices with all the rules of matrix algebra
		reproducing the rules of geometric algebra.  Using the matricies
		hides the underlying geometry and leads to unnecessary
		computation.
		<p>
		The clados package implements Clifford Algebra objects.  These 
		objects can represent any property from physics.  The Moon's 
		momentum and angular momentum can be written as a Monad.  The 
		inertia of an extended mass can be written as a dyad.  
		</font>>
		<hr size=4>
		<a name="Monad">
			<h3>The Monad</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		The Monad class is the basic single-algebra object generator in 
		a flat space.  Most of the physical properties taught in 
		undergraduate physics can be represented with a single-algebra 
		object.
		<p>
		The description of what a Monad is can be summarized as follows.
		<ul>
		<li>A name for the Monad
		<li>A name for the reference frame used to describe the flat
		tangent space.  It is assumed a transformation on the reference
		frame will change this name to demonstrate the action.
		<li>A named location representing the foot of the tangent space.
		This location is the point on the underlying manifold where the
		tangent space is defined as tangent.
		<li>An array of coefficients from the field upon which the
		algebra is defined.  Clados monads are defined upon real
		numbers.
		<li>The number of generators with a sqaure of positive unity.
		<li>The number of generators with a sqaure of negative unity.
		</ul>
		<p>
		The foot name is not used in any serious fashion at this time.
		Later versions of Clados will support transformations of the
		foot along the underlying manifold in some fashion, so it makes
		sense to include place holders in the monad now.
		<p>
		The frame name is used now as a way to ensure Monads using
		different reference frames may be treated as though they were of
		a different type without having to actually declare another
		class within the package.  Passive transformations change the
		reference frame, but no support for them has been coded into the
		monad yet.
		<p>
		Several arrays are figured once the basic information has been
		provided in the list above.  The generator and multiplication
		tables are both produced and kept with each instance of a Monad.
		<p>
		Not all possible metrics of a space are supported within the
		Monad.  The generators with a positive square are listed in the
		generator table before the ones with negative square.  No
		generality is lost with this limitation, though fans of certain
		metrics may find this annoying when they can't write a 
		multivector the way they want.
		</font>>

		<a name="Dyad">
			<h3>The Dyad</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		Some thought has been given concerning how to code a Dyad within
		Clados.  There are some fundamental choices that have to be made
		early.  We have yet to make them.  How these choices work out
		will have a definite impact on how some physical properties like
		rotational inertia and the link between angular momentum and
		angular velocity are written.
		<p>
		A Dyad is the basic two-algebra object generator in a flat
		space.  It may be thought of as two Monads written side-by-side
		with each using a different reference frame.  It is possible for
		each monad to use the same foot location, but the reference
		frames are assumed to be different even if they appear to be
		interchangeable.
		<p>
		A Dyadic is a sum of dyads.  All dyads may be written as a
		dyadic by breaking each Monad into a sum over its basis elements
		and them performing the multiplicative distribution.  It is not 
		so clear that all dyadics simplify to a product of Monads, 
		however.

			<h3>Geometry in three dimensional Euclidian spaces.</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		Newtonian physics is performed in a three dimensional space 
		where time is treated as a parameter of our algebraic equations.
		Three dimensional spaces have four distinct ranks (sometimes 
		called 'grades') for the geometric objects within them.  The 
		basic objects are as follows...<br><br>
		<ul>
		<li>Points - grade 0
		<li>Line segments - grade 1
		<li>Plane segments - grade 2
		<li>Volume segments - grade 3
		</ul>
		Each of these objects has associated with it a sense of 
		magnitude.  Each one except the points also has an associated 
		orientation or direction.
		<p>
		Usage Example 1:<br>
		Imagine a room filled with air.  Each location in the room has 
		associated with it a temperature.  The function representing the
		temperature anywhere takes as input a location defined by useful
		parameters and may output a point with a magnitude equal to the 
		temperature there.
		<pre>
f(location) = point*temperature
		</pre>
		Most people don't bother writing down the 'point' in the 
		algebraic equation, but it can be done.  Don't confuse the 
		parameters of the function describing the location with the 
		point located there.  Many do confuse the two, but they are not 
		the same thing.
		<p>
		Usage Example 2:<br>
		Imagine the room from example one.  If someone puts a fan in a 
		corner and turns it on, the air will move around.  Now each 
		location within the room has associated with it a line segment 
		representing the velocity of the air.
		<pre>
f(location) = directed line segment*speed
		</pre>
		Each line segment can be thought of as a line with an arrow 
		describing which way it points.  There are two directions a line
		segment could point, so we have a positive and negative 
		possibility.
		<p>
		Usage Example 3:<br>
		With the same air filled room from the previous two examples, 
		imagine that each molecule of air was also rotating.  We can now
		associate a small plane segment with each location to represent 
		the equators of each rotating molecule.
		<pre>
f(location) = directed plane segment*rotation speed
		</pre>
		Each plane segment can be thought of as a small loop with an 
		arrow describing which way one goes around on it.  Remember that
		a single plane at the equator can represent two possible 
		rotations; east to west, and west to east.  One direction can be
		positive while the other is negative.  With this notion we turn 
		plane segments into directed plane segments and grade two 
		objects are avialble for use.
		<p>
		Many people are used to using a right hand rule at this point to
		turn a plane segment into a related vector perpendicular to the
		plane.  That operation is called 'taking a dual' in a geometric
		algebra and is unecessary for our work.  It is better to avoid
		using the dual for reasons that might become apparent when a
		'multivector' is defined next.
		<p>
		All three examples can be combined and written as one function 
		if the air in the room is warm, moving, and rotating.  There is 
		no reason why our function must stick to producing geometry of 
		one grade.
		<pre>
f(location) = 	point*temperature + 
		directed line segment*speed + 
		directed plane segment*rotation speed
		</pre>
		It will be left to the reader to put the directed volume segment
		to work for the air filled room example.  Think awhile about the
		Ideal gas law.

			<h3>Algebra in three dimensional Euclidian spaces.</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		Many people find the geometric nature of Clifford Algebras 
		relatively straight forward.  Our intuitions seem well designed 
		for geometry.  Learning the algebraic nature is where most 
		people bog down.
		<p>
		Newtonian physics is performed with equations and the other 
		aspects of algebra.  With its roots in geometry, celestial 
		mechanics took a great leap forward once practitioners could 
		operate algebraically.  This section focuses upon how to write 
		the geometry in a symbolic form that lends itself to easy use 
		and understanding within the framework of algebra.
		<p>
		We start with how to write the various ranked objects in 
		symbolic form.
		<ul>
		<li>A point is a number multiplied by the symbol 'e'
		<li>A directed line segment is a number multiplied by the 
		symbol 'e<sub>i</sub>'
		<li>A directed plane segment is a number multiplied by the 
		symbol 'e<sub>ij</sub>'
		<li>A directed volume segment is a number multiplied by the 
		symbol 'e<sub>ijk</sub>'
		<li>where i, j, and k = 1, 2, or 3
		<li>and i not= j &nbsp;&nbsp; and j not= k &nbsp;&nbsp; 
		and i not= k
		</ul>
		<p>
		There are special names given to each grade that you should probably learn
		if you ever wish to be able to read texts on the subject.
		<ul>
		<li>Points are refered to as scalars.
		<li>Directed line segments are refered to as vectors.
		<li>Directed plane segments are refered to as bivectors and 
		sometimes as psuedovectors.
		<li>Directed volume segments are refered to as trivectors and 
		often as psuedoscalars.
		</ul>
		<p>
		Now it's time to try a few examples of symbolic forms.
		<ul>
		<li>5 is a number
		<li>5e is a scalar
		<li>0e<sub>3</sub> is a vector
		<li>3e<sub>1</sub> is a vector
		<li>-5e<sub>2</sub> is a vector
		<li>0e<sub>12</sub> is a bivector
		<li>3e<sub>23</sub> is a bivector
		<li>5e<sub>123</sub> is a trivector
		<li>5e<sub>321</sub> is a trivector
		</ul>
		<p>
		Now that we have defined the actors on our stage, we must define
		what they do.  In algebra, this is done by defining what we mean
		by addition and multiplication.  Don't assume these operators 
		work the way they do for real numbers.  They do in some ways and
		not in other ways.
		<p>
		<h4>The meaning of addition</h4>
		<p>
		The fastest way to describe how addition works is to give a few 
		examples.  Don't expect all the problems to simplify to a single
		symbol as they would with real numbers.
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>3e + (-5e) = (-2e)
		<li>(-5e) + 3e = (-2e)	{Yes...Addition is commutative}
		<li>6e + 5e<sub>12</sub> = 6e + 5e<sub>12</sub> 
		{No simplification}
		<li>(3e<sub>1</sub> + 2e<sub>3</sub>) + (6e<sub>2</sub> + 
		-3e<sub>3</sub>) = (3e<sub>1</sub> + 6e<sub>2</sub> + 
		-1e<sub>3</sub>)
		</ul>
		Addition works by group terms with similar basis elements and 
		adding the coefficients.
		<p>
		<h4>The meaning of multiplication</h4>
		<p>
		Multiplication is a trickier operation.  It is best defined in 
		terms of the basis vectors.  The other possibilities fall out of
		this partial definition in a consistent manner.
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>e<sub>i</sub> * e<sub>j</sub> = e<sub>ij</sub> if i 
		not= j
		<li>e<sub>i</sub> * e<sub>j</sub> = e if i = j
		<li>and e<sub>ij</sub> = -1e<sub>ji</sub>
		<li>and (a * (b * c)) = ((a * b) * c)) for all a, b, c in the 
		algebra
		</ul>
		<p>
		We can now derive how multiplication works for all other cases.
		Here are some examples.
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>5e * 3e<sub>1</sub> = 15e<sub>1</sub>
		<li>3e<sub>3</sub> * 2e<sub>12</sub> = 6e<sub>312</sub> = 
		6e<sub>123</sub>
		<li>-2e<sub>1</sub> * (6e<sub>2</sub> * 4e<sub>123</sub>) =
		+48e<sub>3</sub>
		</ul>
		Note that multiplication is not always commutative.<br>
		Different basis vectors always anti-commute.
		<p>
		<h4>The multiplication table</h4>
		<p>
		<img src="./images/3dmult.gif">
		<p>
		Multiplying sums of geometry works by distribution.<br>
		(A+B)*(C+D)=A*B + A*D + B*C + B*D
		<p>
		Be careful to write the products in the correct order relative 
		to multiplication.
		<p>
		<h4>Multivector</h4>
		<p>
		A result that contains a mixture of grades is called a 
		'multivector'.
		<p>
		Now that we have a working definition for addition and 
		multiplication, we can apply the rest of the rules we learned 
		from geometry.  Be careful when trying to perform division or 
		use higher level functions.  There are many multivectors that 
		have no multiplicative inverse besides 0e.  For a little 
		practice, see if you can find an object that acts as 
		A<super>-1</super> for the following multivectors.
		<ul>
		<li>A = e<sub>1</sub>
		<li>A = 0.5 * (1e + e<sub>1</sub>)
		<li>A = 0.5 * e<sub>2</sub> * (1e + e<sub>1</sub>)
		</ul>
		<p>
		<h4>Enough</h4>
		<p>
		Give it a try.<br><br>
		If all this is still obscure, you probably need some other 
		exposure to the subject.  Look it up in the math text books and 
		grab a comfortable seat.
