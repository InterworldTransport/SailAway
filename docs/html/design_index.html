			<h3>Design Context</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		The SailAway application is a system largely designed and developed at 
		Interworld Transport with some help from volunteers interested in
		advancing the cause of solar sail technologies.  The primary result of
		this foundation is that the design of the application is largely driven
		by business interests and practices.
		<p>
		It is expected that SailAway will meet the requirements drafted for its
		next round of development.  The manner in which it does so is not
		currently influenced by those who are perceived to be the application's
		biggest user.  To defend against unnecessary design and development, the
		user interfaces were purposely under described during the requirements
		gathering phase.  The designers of SailAway will be expected to
		compensate by crafting an approach that makes the bulk of the user
		interface a pluggable component for the System.  An example UI will be
		designed and developed, but it must be swappable during later phases
		when the primary customers start making demands concerning the bahavior
		of SailAway.
		<p>
		To meet these high level expectations, the initial package plan for the
		application is as follows.
		<ul>
		<li>The Physical Model (PM):  This package will provide for 
		encapsulation of the physics within the application.  No physical 
		calculations may take place outside its confines.
		<li>The User Interface (UI):  This package will encapsulate the portions
		of the application with which the Users interact.  No user viewable 
		portion of the application may be included anywhere else.
		<li>The Event Model (EM):  This package encapsulates the rules by which 
		a UI may interact with the Physical Model
		<li>The Notification Tool Interface (NTI):  This package encapsulates
		the portions of the application responsible for handling messages meant
		for outbound, external communication channels.
		<li>The Library Interface (LI):  This package encapsulates the portions
		of the application responsible for interacting with local and remote
		libraries.
		<li>The Supporting Class Libraries:  These package will encapsulate all
		other entities upon which SailAway will depend.  Foreign packages that 
		are not used in a piece-meal fashion are included here.
