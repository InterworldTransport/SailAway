			<h3>Overview</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		SailAway is a solar sail simulator application meant to 
		demonstrate realistic flight paths for a simple light sail on 
		flights through the inner solar system.  Solar radiation 
		pressure effects on the sail are treated as perturbations upon 
		the orbit constants.  This has the affect of treating the sail 
		as if it were temporarily on a Keplerian orbit while the orbit 
		is treated as a slowly varying or osculating object.
		<p>
		SailAway is currently organized in four separate packages.  Each of the 
		packages organize the java classes into distinct units that perform 
		defineable functions in the application.  Each package is listed and 
		summarized below.
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>The User Interface
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			All classes in this package encapsulate the
			the the user interfaces available to human and
			automated operators.  This encapsulation is 
			meant to isolate the user interface from the
			underlying physics and how events are delivered 
			to and from the physical model.  Changes to 
			classes in the user interface arise from
			alterations or additions to the ways an
			operater may interact with the application as a
			whole.
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>The Event model
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			All classes in this package encapsulate the
			the interaction between the user interface and
			the physical model.  This encapsulation is meant
			to isolate the user interface from the
			underlying physics.  Changes to classes in the
			event model arise from changes in the physical
			model that affect what the user sees or does or 
			from changes to the user interface that require
			interaction with the physical model
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>The Physical model
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			All classes in this package encapsulate the
			physical properties of a solar sail and the
			physical laws one would obey  Changes to classes
			in the physical model arise from improvements to
			the modelling of a solar sail or of the physical
			laws.
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>The clados model
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			All classes in this package encapsulate the
			mathematics used to represent physical objects in the 
			application.  The underlying mathematics is one based
			upon geometric algebras sometimes referred to more 
			formally as Clifford algebras.  Changes to classes in 
			the clados package result from improvements in the
			manner in which Clifford algebras and implemented and
			the addition of convenience methods for each class.
			</p>
			</font>
		</ul>
		The first two packages are common to most applications of any type; 
		though they may be called by different names and grouped in different 
		ways.  The third package is what makes SailAway a solar sail simulator.
		The fourth package is a math library and is supported as a separate 
		project named 'Clados'.

		<a name="Limits">
			<h3>Current Limits to the simulation</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		There are some limitations to where one may take a sail
		simulation and still expect the application to deliver accurate
		results.  These limitations may be of a physical or development
		nature.  Physical limitations are those imposed by the physical
		laws.  All other limitations are those imposed by inadequacies
		of the techniques and how they are implemented in the
		application.  The limitations of which a user must be aware are
		listed below along with a summarization.
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>Stay away from planets and other secondary gravitators.
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			The sail currently uses a simple OrbitEllipse and its
			related Perturber.  Proximity to a planet violates the
			assumption that the sail orbit is approximately
			elliptical.  All perturbing forces are assumed to be 
			much smaller than the central force responsible for the
			ellipse.
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>Stay away from unbounded orbits.
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			The sail currently uses a simple OrbitEllipse and its
			related Perturber.  It is possible the two classes can
			handle unbounded paths, but the secondary parameter set
			delivered to the user interface assumes an ellipse.
			Flying on unbounded paths is likely to break one of the
			methods that calculates the secondary set.
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>Stay away from rectilinear orbits.
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			The sail currently uses a simple OrbitEllipse and its
			related Perturber.  A rectilinear orbit has a zero
			magnitude monad for the orbital angular momentum.  This
			leads to problems calculating further properties.  The
			OrbitEllipse is not set up to detect these problems and
			avoid them yet.
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>Stay away from orbits with undefined parameters.
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			The sail currently uses a simple OrbitEllipse and its
			related Perturber.  It is assumed the orbit is an
			ellipse where the semimajor axis, eccentricity,
			inclination, ascending node, and periapsis angle are
			defined.  Some closed orbits leave one or more of these
			parameters undefined.  While the OrbitEllipse and
			Perturber can probably represent such orbits, the
			calculation of the secondary parameters for delivery to
			the user interface may present an uncaught problem.  A
			circular orbit in the equatorial plane is a good example
			that leaves several problems.
			</p>
			</font>
		<li>Stay away from large perturbing forces.
			<p>
			<font size=2>
			The sail uses a simple Perturber.  If the forces
			altering the orbit of the sail are not small compared to
			the central gravity force, the perturber will not catch
			this fact.  Instead the perturber will try smaller time
			slices hoping to find one that produces a small enough
			change to the orbit angular momentum and runge-lenz
			vector to pass the tolerance test.  If the perturbing
			forces are large enough, no slice will be found before
			the number of decimals available in the double primitive
			runs out.  Running out of decimals will result in a zero
			time slice that cannot be reduced.  The perturber will
			become trapped and the application will keep running
			with no apparent affect.

			<h3>Feature List</h3>
		</a>
		<font size=3>
		<p>
		This early development version of SailAway has a limited set of features
		that actually work.  Many menu choices are present on the application 
		menu, but only the simplest ones needed to debug the physical model are
		working or being developed.  Users of this early version of the
		simulator should expect the interface to change noticeably after the
		user requirements are properly worked out.  The physical model is the
		only part of the application not likely to change much.
		<p>
		<b>Orbit Iteration</b>
		<p>
		A sail defined in the Sail.profile file may be started
		and stepped forward or backward through discrete steps
		along its orbit.  Each step is worked through to
		completion with all sail, orbit, perturber, and
		perturber forces data members refreshed in the
		appropriate area of the user interface.
		<p>
		There is one exception to the updating of the sail properties 
		after one orbit step.  Since there is no implementation of a 
		dyad in the clados package yet, there is no good way to 
		represent the sail's rotational inertia.  Without the rotational
		inertia, it is not possible to properly handle the sail's 
		internal angular momentum and attitude.  Therefore, no torques 
		internal to the sail body are handled yet.  Places in the source
		code have been marked for eventual inclusion of this exception 
		and its related parts.
		<p>
		<b>Tools/Viewers</b>
		<p>
		The Tools menu has options for displaying detailers giving a summary of 
		parts of the sail state and showing displayers to deliver details about 
		the monads internal to the physical model. The over all menu may seem to
		be mis-named with the collection of choices under it. Later versions of 
		the menu will permit some interaction between the user and the object 
		displayed through an as-yet-to-be-developed feature centered on the 
		concepts of a mission plan and a target profile.
		<p>
		The Detailers show summary numbers about the state of the
		sail, the summed perturbing force, and the orbit.  These
		detailers are part of the oldest graphical interface and
		show properties most likely to be viewed by a user
		through numerous orbit steps.
		<p>
		The Monad displayers show the internal members of the
		various monads that make up the physical model.  Each
		monad important to determining the current state of the
		sail is reachable through these displayers.  No
		alteration of these Monads may be performed through
		these features yet.
		<p>
		There are place holders present for the eventual control
		of the application options and time flow multiplier
		between real time and simulator time.  Since there is no
		mechanism yet developed for multiple stepping through an
		orbit, there is no need to complete the time rate
		feature or the complex options dialogs.
