            We made many good contacts at the SFF conference in LA recently. We have also begun to hear from many voices concern that the code base is in JAVA instead of C++.  I am not concerned about the language differences unless it hampers the number of  people willing to help out on the project.  I have a Linux machine and would be willing to work in C++ for that environment if someone would be willing to help convert the current code.<br>
I have also heard many people saying the project needs supporting documentation to get going.  Architecture, future features planned,and other important documents are, therefore, underway.

            On Sept 19, our most recent equipment was loaded into a JPA test vehicle for flight.  Unfortunately, the motor casing on the rocket came apart and wrecked part of their avionics bay.  Our equipment was spared injury and will fly again another day. <br>
Included in the current hardware is a boom mounting module and a center attachment module rigged on a small mast.  The boom mounting core spins to roll the booms into the center chamber for stowage.  The booms are not fabricated yet.<br>

                The talk at NASA Ames on 8/12/1999 went pretty well.  A couple of people expressed an interest in working on the simulator.  I'm currently betting new features will get added as extra modules that know how to interact with the core model.  This approach would be very Unix-like since it would result in several smaller tools that worked well together.

                JPA will be back on the desert for a low key test of a couple vehicles during the Fireballs event.  One of the vehicles promises to be a full six inches in diameter.  This doubling of the payload bay diameter means a lot more room is available for the sail booms.  Our next test model will not stop at one meter booms as a result.  We will build them to at least three and possibly five meters using the same sail core.

We now have our own domain.  I am taking this opportunity to trim some of the unnecessary pages a little and move parts of our projects those willing to host them.  After I get our images loaded on this site, I will probably rework the front page to give it a more professional appearance.  Check back soon.  -al

            We finished up the flight profile for the last flight a few days
ago.  I have posted the altitude vs time graph 
<a href="http://www.interworldtransport.com/21133/Space_flight_19990523.gif">here</a>.<br><br>
I will be heading to the Lunar Conference in Houston next month.  There is a good
chance I'll be able to make some friends and get some interested people working on 
making incrimental solar sail hardware development a reality.  Keep your fingers crossed.

            <font size=2>Our test equipment flew on 05/23/99 on a abbreviated flight.  The winds were strong to 
the west on the morning of the flight.  Had JPA waited for the balloons to reach the scheduled 
launch altitude, we would have been out of radio range and the FAA safety range.  JP made the decision
to launch early and the rocket did not reach space as a result.  However, from IWT's perspective, the
test flight still produced the results we needed to proceed.  Our payload was subjected to launch 
stresses on the order of 30g's and it survived.  The parachute did strip away from the payload section, 
so our equipment hit the ground upside down at about 40 mph and still survived that.  It is 
possible the current configuration is a little over-built, but it will do.<br><br>
We did not get the sail stowage module completed before the flight, but it will fly next time.  
Hopefully, we will have a mechanism complete to kick the equipment out of the payload bay for free
flight testing next time too.</font>

            Our next flight will be on May 22, 1999 if the weather holds out.
JPA has their waiver for the space flight, so everything is legal.  Our hardware test
will be onboard.</font>

     The JPA crew meets tonight.  We will be planning the
logistics for the next flight on May 22.  Our sail hardware has to be
ready soon.<br>
The next test will involve seeing if the sail structure can survive the
launch accelerations.  Our last one didn't, so it was back to the drawing
board.
