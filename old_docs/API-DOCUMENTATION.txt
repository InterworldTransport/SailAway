	SailAway API Documentation

API Documentation can be generated much like a compiled version
of SailAway can be generated.

From the top of a working copy of the repository, do the 
following:

	(Edit the Makefile to produce your own doctitle
	if you wish to do so.)

	make doc

This command will generate a directory named docs/api within the 
SailAway source directory.  Within docs/api can be found the 
output of javadoc as applied to the entire com.interworldtransport
package tree.  The packages that get documented are listed
within Makedocpackage.
