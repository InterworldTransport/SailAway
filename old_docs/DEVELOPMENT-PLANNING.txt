               SailAway Development Plan

This file, APPLICATION-PLAN, contains the plan by which the
SailAway development group operates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Charter for the sailaway-plan mailing list:

The SailAway Planner's List exists to help people with access to the
SailAway source repository coordinate the architecture planning
associated with the project.

Everyone who has been given checkin access to the repository for the
SailAway sources should read sailaway-plan.  Only those with an interest
in influencing the architecture of the application should send messages 
to the list.  The list will not block submissions unless it is abused.

The sailaway-plan list may be used to discuss:
- changes or features to packages other than SailAway if they relate
  back to the application plan
- changes and features intended for inclusion in the official SailAway
  application plan, which someone plans to implement, or has 
  implemented.

The sailaway-plan list should not be used to discuss:
- administrivia regarding the SailAway source repository and release
  process
- changes which nobody has offered to implement
These topics should be handled off list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Policies regarding the SailAway source repository:

By discussing items on the sailaway-plan list, authors agree to 
permit inclusion of their ideas and implementation of them under the
terms of the GNU Public License.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure for dealing with people who want to be application planners:

People who have checkin access are welcome to discussion the overall
direction of the application on sailaway-plan.  If the list traffic 
becomes too large, we will move the discussion to a BBS.  It is intended
that developers that want a say in direction will be able to make their
voices heard.  If they can convince the maintainer and community of the 
worthiness of their ideas, those ideas will be incorporated into the 
application plan.
