               SailAway Development Policies

This file, DEVELOPMENT-POLICIES, contains the policies by which the SailAway
development group operates. Also see the HACKING file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charter for the sailaway-develop mailing list:

The SailAway Developers' List exists to help developers with access to the
SailAway source repository co-ordinate changes, make releases, and administer
the repository.

Everyone who has checkin access to the repository for the SailAway sources
should read sailaway-devel. Only those with checkin access should send messages
to the list. This list does not currently block others from posting and won't do
so unless it is abused.

The sailaway-develop list may be used to discuss:
- administrivia regarding the SailAway source repository and release
  process, and
- changes and features intended for inclusion in the official SailAway
  release (either source code or documentation), which someone plans
  to implement, or has implemented.

The sailaway-develop list should not be used to discuss:
- changes or features to packages other than the SailAway release
- changes which nobody has offered to implement
These topics should be handled off list.

The topic restrictions in this charter do not reflect the development group's
future plans for SailAway; rather, they reflect a topic classification which the
group finds helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Policies regarding the SailAway source repository:

By checking items into the repository, developers agree to permit distribution
of such items under the terms of the GNU Public License version 2.  They are
not necessarily assigning their copyright to anyone else on the project unless
they make it obvious that they intend to do so.  A simple statement in the
Change Notes for the commit of new code can be used for copyright assignment if
the developer wishes it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Policy for dealing with people who want to be developers:

People who want checkin access are first requested to send patches and have them
reviewed by a developer. If they submit some good ones (preferably over a period
of time, to demonstrate sustained interest), then one of the developers can ask
the SailAway maintainer whether it is OK to make this person a developer (after
first making sure the prospective developer has read a copy of this file and
then having the prospective developer say they want to be a SailAway developer).
If there are no objections among the current developers and the maintainer, the
person will be made a developer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Policy regarding checkout-only access:

Checkout-only access to the SailAway repository is available to all, on an
anonymous basis. The exact technical mechanisms by which it is available are not
covered by this policy.  At present, the source code is available via anonymous
checkout through CVS from SourceForge.net

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Policy regarding name credit in requirements, design and development
documentation.

Some lines of the supporting documentation show the name of the project 
participant who contributed a definition, description, or iteration.  These
names are present to help readers identify the primary contact person for
questions about content and to give some credit for the work done.  When
another person changes a previous section, their name should be added to the
credit and possibly replace the original author.  Rough guidelines for how to
handle these changes are as follows.

	1.	If the change is mostly editorial in manner, no authorship change should
	be made.
	2.	If the change is an alteration of the part leaving most of the content
	intact, the second author's name should be appended to the first making a
	comma separated list.
	3.	If the change is sufficiently large that the primary author may no
	longer be the subject matter expert but may still know enough to help a
	curios reader, the second author's name should be prepended to the first
	making a comma separated list.
	4.	If the change is large enough that the primary author really has
	nothing to do anymore with the new content, the second author's name should
	replace the first.

Remember that the real purpose of the name credits in SailAway documentation is
to provide readers with a point of contact that could answer detailed questions.
