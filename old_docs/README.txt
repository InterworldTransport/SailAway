Welcome to SailAway!

If you have problems or think you have found a bug in SailAway, see the
project site at sourceforge.net for contact names and addresses.  We would
prefer you report the bug through the Sourceforge mechanism, however, and 
offer to work on it in a more timely manner if you do.

If you are thinking of submitting changes to SailAway, see the
file HACKING.  You are encouraged to think this way!

Please consult the INSTALL file for information on tested
configurations.  If you have a comment about an already tested
configuration, or have tried SailAway on a new configuration, please let us
know as described in INSTALL.  Free software only works if we all help
out.

Finally, we cannot guarantee that this release will not completely wipe out
all of your work and simulations from your system.  We do some simple testing
before each release, but you are completely on your own.  We recommend testing
this release on files that are not critical to your work.
THIS SOFTWARE IS SUPPLIED COMPLETELY "AS IS".  NO WARRANTY....

Thanks for your support!

Credits:

Alfred Differ, Interworld Transport <adiffer@jpaerospace.com> wrote the 
original code in the clados and sailmodel packages.  (I also wrote the first
sailgui and sailevent packages, but I don't expect them to last once the 
project is opened up to other developers.  They were written in order to present
a workable starting application to interested users and developers.)
