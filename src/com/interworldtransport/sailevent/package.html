<h2>Background</h2>
This is the package defined to be the event model for the SailAway application.
It contains all classes needed to handle events generated from components of the
user interface. Proper design of the SailAway application is accomplished by
separating the event model from the user interface.
<p>
This package is organized as follows.  
<ol>
<li>The SailEvent Model
<li>The Menu Parent handlers
<li>The Menu Item handlers
</ol>
<p>
This package is meant to be handled by a SailAway instance, but any user
interface that uses the API correctly will suffice. Different user interfaces
will require alterations to the event model to support added features.
<p>
The events currently supported are all tied to actions triggered by Menu choices
from sailgui. There are a number of menu items that are not well defined at this
time, so they will be listed here until the documentation takes better shape.
<p>
The File Menu
<ul>
<li>New
<p>
This command should start a new Sail and attach it to the running GUI. Any
previously running Sail should be terminated if it was still attached to the
GUI. This command should query the user for a variety of information to
initialize a new Sail. Template Sails should be pickable from a list much like
template documents are pickable in high-end word processors.
<li>Open
<p>
This command should start an existing Sail and attach it to the running GUI. Any
previously running Sail should be terminated if it was still attached to the
GUI. This command should query the user for a variety of information to
initialize the Sail if the profile is not complete.
<li>Capture Data
<p>
This command should force the creation of an Ephemeris file for the attached
Sail if one does not already exist. SailProps should be updated to reflect the
new Ephemeris file if needed. It should then turn the controlling boolean to
'true' so new Ephemeris information gets saved.
<li>Print All
<p>
This command should print what is currently visible on the GUI to a printer of
the user's choice.
<li>Exit
<p>
This command should terminate the application and close all connections it might
have with files and sockets. Later versions of this command should only close
the GUI and permit the physical model to run unattended. A command for
separating a Sail from its GUI will be needed to make this work.
<p>
This command is currently functioning.
</ul>
<p>
The Edit Menu
<ul>
<li>Sail Properties
<p>
This command should bring up a window that would permit the Sail properties to
be changed on the fly. These properties are the same ones as found in the
Sail.profile file. Changes to these properties should be reflected in SailProps,
but not in the Sail.profile file without further orders from the user. Changes
to the Sail Properties should get saved as comments in the Ephemeris file and
possibly in other supporting places.
<li>Orbit Properties
<p>
This command should bring up a window that would permit the Orbit properties to
be changed on the fly. These properties are not available in any of the
supporting files. Changes to these properties should reflect events not within
the scope of SailAway such as collisions, grappling, and other outside
influences. As SailAway evolves, the list of events handled in this manner will
be absorbed by specialized methods.
<li>View Point
<p>
This command should allow the user to specify a new viewing plane from which the
GUI can draw the graphical presentations. This command should also allow the
user to apply the change.
</ul>
<p>
The Tools Menu
<ul>
<li>Time Rate
<p>
This command should really be renamed. It will be used to control the size of
the orbit steps taken during iteration. Setting a new step should force the Sail
to at least try the step specified by the user before settling on one that obeys
the level of tolerance allowed by the Sail. The user also has to be able to
change the tolerance level.
<li>Show Orbit
<li>Show Sail
<li>Show Orbit Details
<li>Show Sail Details
<li>Show Sail Forces 
<li>Options
<p>
This command should allow the user to specify changes to the overall
configuration of the SailAway application. Changes made here should be reflected
in the SailAway.conf file if they are normally 
stored there.
</ul>
<p>
The Actions Menu
<ul>
<li>Iterate Forward
<p>
This command is responsible for making the simulation step forward one finite
step along the orbit of the sail. Any features of the iteration that are turned
on before this event result in calculations.
<p>
This command is currently functioning.
<li>Iterate Backward
<p>
This command is responsible for making the simulation step backward one finite
step along the orbit of the sail. Any features of the iteration that are turned
on before this event result in calculations. This command effective reverses the
forward stepper except for round-off errors.
<p>
This command is currently functioning.
<li>Change View Point
<p>
This command is not needed since it can be handled by the Edit|View Point
command. It will be renamed and given another purpose later.
</ul>
<p>
The Windows Menu
<ul>
<li>Pack
<p>
This command should redraw the SailAway frame and its contents.
<li>Close
<p>
This command should close an active window with the SailAway frame. Since the
current GUI is using panels instead of windows, this command is useless.  
<li>Iconify
<p>
This command should iconify the SailAway frame.
</ul>
<p>
The Help Menu
<ul>
<li>Support
<p>
This command should display a window with information telling the user where
they may get help and technical support.
<li>About
<p>
This command should display a window with information telling the user who
created and tested the various parts that make up SailAway.
</ul>
<p>
Future versions of the sailevent package will track closely to features
available in the user interface.
