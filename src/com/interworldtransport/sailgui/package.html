<h2>Background</h2>
User interaction with a solar sailing physical model is accomplished through a user interface.
The sailgui package is a simple user interface for the sailmodel package meant to display basic
information about a sail's orbit, attitude, accelerations, and other related information.  The sailgui
package makes minor use of the clados package in order to draw the sail, orbit, and reference frame.
<p>
The sailgui package is a collection of classes that handle information for the user.  The class named
SailAway effectively owns all the parts of the application, but most control is wielded from the
sailevent package.  The SailAway class instantiates all the early parts of the user interface and
prepares the rest for control by the sailevent classes.

<p>
The sailgui package is designed as it is to be modular.  It is intended that users of the full SailAway 
application be able to swap in their own user interface in place of sailgui.  Users with sophisticated
user interface classes may want to include their work within sailgui.  If this package evolves much beyond
what the current author has written, the SailAway class will become an Interface instead and allow the more
advanced classes to take over the details.
<p>
Future versions of the sailgui package will include features from the following list.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Restarting of the application using a new .profile file
<li>Inclusion of a macro-oriented .command file for running the Sail through predefined steps
<li>Graphical & textual representation of the Sail's parameters
<li>Graphical & textual representation of target parameters from a .mission file
<li>Representation of differences between Sail current parameters and target parameters.
<li>Graphical representation of a Sail's Structure object.
<li>A better set of exceptions to handle programmatic errors.
</ul>
