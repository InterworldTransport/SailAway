<h2>Background</h2>
The SailAway application isolates all activities requiring library interaction
events to a single package.  This package will be the only one responsible for
interfacing with local and remote libraries for the storage and retrieval of
objects.  This package, therefore, will be a collection of classes whose sole
purpose is to transfer information betweeb SailAway and the libraries upon
which it will depend.
<p>
The first version of the sailli package will include features for storing and
retrieving objects from the local library.  Future versions will include other 
communication channels to remote libraries as they become available.
