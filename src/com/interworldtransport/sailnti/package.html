<h2>Background</h2>
The SailAway application isolates all activities requiring user notification of
events to a single package.  This package will be the only one responsible for
interfacing with email, chat, and other notification system external to
SailAway.  This package, therefore, will be a collection of classes whose sole
purpose is to deliver information from SailAway into those external channels.
<p>
The first version of the sailnti package will include features for sending
emails.  Future versions will include other communication channels as they come
into demand by the user community.
